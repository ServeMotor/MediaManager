This Terms of Sale governs the sale of digital products (the “Digital Products”) offered by the Washington Post, 1301 K Street NW, Washington, DC 20071. By using the Digital Products, you also agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

Users located in the EU, UK, and Québec should refer to Section 10 for additional information. You understand that your rights related to your use of the Digital Products may depend on where you reside.

1. Digital Products

The Washington Post Digital Products include the website (www.washingtonpost.com), mobile site, and tablet and mobile apps. You are not necessarily required to purchase anything to use The Post’s Digital Products. If you do not purchase a subscription or product, however, your access to the Digital Products will be limited.

You can view The Post’s various recurring subscription offerings at https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com. We may also offer gift subscriptions and limited-term and limited-scope access offerings.

The Post reserves the right to modify the content, type and availability of any Digital Product at any time. If you do not cancel your subscription for the Digital Products after the modifications become effective, you agree to the modifications.

2. Subscription

a. Auto-renewing Subscription. If you purchase a recurring subscription, your Digital Products subscription, which may start with a promotional rate or free trial, will auto-renew at the frequency stated at the time of your order unless cancelled. You will be charged your first subscription fee and any applicable taxes on the date you purchase your Digital Products subscription or after your free trial ends. Your Digital Products subscription will automatically continue at the stated interval, and you will continue to be charged at the stated price (including any applicable taxes) at the beginning of each billing cycle (“Billing Period”) unless prior to the end of your current Billing Period: (a) you terminate your account; (b) you cancel your subscription (as described below); (c) we decline to renew your subscription; or (d) these Terms of Sale are otherwise properly terminated as expressly permitted herein. You can view the date of your next scheduled payment by accessing your account on our website, clicking on the “Subscription & Billing” tab, and selecting “Manage subscription”. If any subscription fee is not paid in a timely manner, or your transaction cannot be processed, we reserve the right to suspend, disable, cancel or terminate your Digital Products subscription.

If a stated price or other material information is determined by us in our sole discretion to be in error, we are not under any obligation to offer you the Digital Products at that price and reserve the right to cancel, terminate or not process your order (including accepted orders). We will notify you of the error and either provide you with a refund or give you the opportunity to cancel your order and obtain a refund if payment has already been made.

b. Differing Subscriptions/Promotions. The Post may offer a number of types of subscriptions, including subscriptions to different Washington Post products and special promotions. Any materially different terms from those described in these Terms of Sale will be disclosed at the time of purchase or in other communications made available to you. You can find specific details regarding your subscription by accessing your account on our website and clicking on the “Subscription & Billing” tab. We reserve the right to change or terminate any offered subscriptions or promotions at any time.

c. Locked-In, Fixed-Rate Subscriptions. The Post may, in its sole discretion, offer a subscription in which you agree to pay a recurring, locked-in fixed subscription rate each billing cycle until cancelled. If such subscription is ever cancelled or terminated for any reason, you will permanently lose your fixed-rate and may not be able to take advantage of another fixed-rate subscription, although you may be able to re-subscribe at other rates offered by the Post for a specified period of time.

d. Premium+ Subscription. Users in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and Switzerland have the option to subscribe to our Premium+ product, which offers unlimited access to www.washingtonpost.com (the “Site”) on any device, as well as all of our apps. The Premium+ product has no advertising or third-party ad tracking on the Site. Please note, however, that the Site, may include content embedded from other sites and services (such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube) and that such third-party content may contain some advertising and third-party ad tracking from those sites or services. In addition, our apps and newsletters may contain advertising and third-party ad tracking. Please view our Privacy Policy for more information and Section 10 of these Terms of Sale for more information about your rights depending on where you reside.

3. Billing

a. Payment Method. You can pay for your subscription or purchase with a major credit card or through other payment methods made available during the purchase process (“Payment Method”). Accepted Payment Methods may vary based on your location. You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting your My Post account on our website.

b. Recurring Billing. By placing an order for a recurring subscription, you authorize us to charge you the subscription fee then in effect at the beginning of each Billing Period, plus applicable taxes, to your Payment Method. You acknowledge that the amount charged each Billing Period may vary for reasons that may include price changes, changing your subscription, or changes in applicable taxes, and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amount each Billing Period. Applicable taxes may vary. For example, you authorize us to charge your Payment Method the promotional rate disclosed on the subscription screen for the agreed upon promotional Billing Periods (if applicable) and the regular subscription rate in subsequent Billing Periods, each with applicable taxes. We automatically charge your Payment Method on the first day of each Billing Period. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, in the event your Payment Method has not successfully settled. If your Payment Method is declined for a recurring payment of your subscription fee, you have four (4) days to provide us a new Payment Method or your subscription will be canceled. If your payment is unsuccessful by reason of insufficient funds, expiration, or otherwise, you remain responsible for any uncollected amount.

c. Subscription Fee Changes. Except as otherwise set forth herein, we reserve the right to change subscription fees for any of our subscriptions at any time. If the regular fee for your recurring subscription increases from the fee stated at the time of your initial order, we will notify you before applying the change to your subscription or charging you in connection with an automatic renewal. You will have an opportunity to cancel your subscription at that time. If you do not cancel your recurring subscription, you will be charged the new subscription fee when we charge you for your next Billing Period.

d. Billing Period. We will charge the subscription fee at the commencement of your recurring subscription or, if applicable, at the end of your free trial period, and automatically on the first day of each Billing Period thereafter unless and until your subscription is cancelled.

e. One-Time Purchases. When you purchase a stand-alone product, such as a gift subscription or purchase that grants you access to the Digital Products for a limited amount of time (“Access Period”) or for a limited scope (e.g., access to a limited number of articles), we will charge your Payment Method at the time of purchase.

f. Currency. The currency in which you will be billed will be stated during the purchase process. All prices are in United States dollars, unless otherwise stated.

4. Free Trials and Promotional Rates. We may offer promotions to obtain a subscription on a trial basis for free or at a promotional rate. If your subscription includes a free trial, you will not be charged the applicable fee during your free trial. To obtain the free trial, you will be required to provide a Payment Method in order to ensure uninterrupted access and continued use after the expiration of the free trial. Upon completion of your free trial, your subscription will automatically convert into a recurring paid subscription and your Payment Method will be charged the applicable fee unless you have cancelled your subscription before your free trial ends. You may cancel your subscription during your free trial to avoid being charged as described above; such cancellation may be effective immediately.

If your subscription includes a promotional rate, you will be charged the promotional rate for the agreed upon number of Billing Periods and upon completion of those Billing Periods, your subscription will continue to automatically renew at the regular rate.

You may only be permitted to use one free trial or promotional rate offer. If your subscription is ever cancelled or terminated for any reason, and you purchase an additional subscription, you may not be eligible for a free trial or to take advantage of another promotional rate.

5. Cancellations and Refunds

a. Cancellations. You can cancel your recurring subscription at any time by visiting your My Post account on our website. You must cancel your subscription before it renews each Billing Period to avoid being billed the next Billing Period’s subscription fees to your Payment Method. Cancellation only applies to future charges associated with your subscription, and you will not receive a refund for the current Billing Period. Your cancellation will become effective at the end of your current Billing Period, and you will continue to have access to your subscription for the remainder of the Billing Period (except that if you cancel your subscription during a free trial period, your cancellation may become effective immediately). Any purchases of a Digital Product through a third party (e.g., app store), are subject to that third party’s cancellation policies and procedures.

b. Refunds. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED HEREIN OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION OR PURCHASE FEE IS NONREFUNDABLE. If you cancel your subscription or stop using your limited-term or limited-scope access offering, you are not entitled to receive any refund or credits, including for the time remaining in your Billing Periods or Access Period, and you will continue to have access to your subscription until the end of your current Billing Period or Access Period (unless we provide you with a refund or credit), or in the case of a limited-scope offering, you will continue to have access to the product you purchased (unless we provide you with a refund or credit). We reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion. If we issue a refund or credit in one instance, we are under no obligation to issue the same refund or credit in the future.

Users in the EU, UK, and Québec should review Section 10 for additional information about their rights.

We will provide these Electronic Communications by posting them on the Washington Post website, posting within your account, and/or emailing them to your primary email address associated with your Digital Products subscription. You agree that the Electronic Communications will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing. Electronic Communications will be deemed received by you within 24 hours of the time posted to our website or the “My Account” page, or within 24 hours of the time emailed to you unless we receive notice that the email was not delivered.

    sufficient storage space or other storage methods (e.g., a USB drive or secure online storage) to save past Electronic Communications or a printer to print them.

You confirm that you have access to the necessary equipment and are able to receive, open, print, or store Electronic Communications.

You must keep your primary email address up to date and ensure that it is valid and operational. You can change your primary email address by accessing your account on our website and clicking on the “Account Access” tab.

7. Changes to the Terms of Sale. We may, from time to time, change these Terms of Sale. When such changes are made, we will make a copy of the new Terms of Sale available to you on our website. If you do not cancel the services after the changes become effective, you agree to the changed terms.

8. Termination. We may terminate your subscription at our sole discretion and without any notice. If we cancel your subscription, we may give you a prorated refund based on the amount of time remaining that you cannot use; provided, however, that we will not be obligated to grant you a refund if we terminate your account or your subscription because we determine, in our sole discretion, that your use of the services violates these Terms of Sale, our Terms of Service, any applicable law, or has harmed another user.
