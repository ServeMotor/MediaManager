"We work with you to determine the number of people who require frequent access to FT content. 'Frequent' means reading nine or more articles within a 30 day period. We call these people ‘core readers’ and you pay for their access and a volume discount is applied. We also provide access to a wider group of people who just need to read the FT occasionally. By occasionally, we mean anybody who reads eight or fewer articles in a 30 day period. We don’t charge for their access to the FT."
