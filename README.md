# MediaManager

I changed the focus to putting together mosaics of different information from content to better get information on a topic of interest. The project will still focus on content sources, and trying to pair them or group them so information can be compared and contrasted. The idea is to help drive insights on a particular topic.

MediaManager is a collection of Markdown pages with links to news or information which can be used for online research.

 As an example of data aggregation as done by an organization, which could be one of the sources a user reads, "...the Bloomberg Terminal carries more than 1,000 news sources in 30+ languages globally and provides a powerful search engine to capture content from 90,000 web sources and social media." An individual user might not read or consume even a tenth of 1% of those sources.

On another repo, [Fin](./in), I have a folder called urlbuilder where I put links to different content in the Financial Times.
