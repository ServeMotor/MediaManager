# MediaManager

Update 3/14/2025

MediaManager is for users to manage links to content in media sites in English and Japanese, including RSS feeds to article content. It includes snapshots of the website structure for news media websites, including the Financial Times so users can create their own direct links to content instead of going through the front pages for the news websites. 

Japanese content is created by translating the English language content via Google Translate or Deepl.

Google tools are used to filter the content from media websites by importing RSS feeds into Google Sheets via functions and scripting tools.
