# MediaManager

Update 10/29/2024

MediaManager is a collection of Markdown pages with links to news or information which can be used for online research. It serves as the basis for [audiologiks.com](https://www.audiologiks.com).


Site Index
--
1. *china_sources.md* - Looking at X (formerly twitter) and other social media sites to find writers on China's politics, economy and business.
	
2. *fin_screener.md* - These are screener apps that present financial data and allow the user to filter and organize financial data by different categories, tags and other attributes.
	
3. *links_media.md* - A list of English-language (and some other language) media organizations with online links that are featured on the US politics website, The Drudge Report. These would capture a variety of views and subjects, with different online audiences.

4. *news_aggregators.md* - Two examples of online news aggregators, Google News and Yahoo News. These aggregate and display headlines on different topics and can be filtered, in Google's case, by language and country.

5. *other_media.md* - Examples of English-language US media websites in specialist areas, including Investigative, Business, Technology, Cybersecurity and Financial News.
	
6. *sub_site_review.md* - Organizational subscriber numbers for The Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal, along with partner organizations.

7. app - a folder to put content for the 10-11 media sources used for RSS feeds on [audiologiks.com](https://www.audiologiks.com)

8. lang - Other language versions can be shared here, though in stub form.

On another repo, [Fin](https://www.github.com/ServeMotor/fin/sources/research/ftsub/tools), I have a folder called urlbuilder where I put links to different content in the Financial Times.
