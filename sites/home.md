Overview of a Ransomware group

"Matveev, besides working as an affiliate for Conti, LockBit, Hive, Trigona, and NoEscape, also had a management-level role with the Babuk ransomware group up until early 2022, while sharing what's being described as a "complex relationship" with another actor named Dudka, who is likely the developer behind Babuk and Monti."

[Cybersecurity Ventures](https://cybersecurityventures.com/ransomware-minute/) - Daily Report on Ransomware

"A successful initial compromise is followed by a string of actions as part of the attack lifecycle, including privilege escalation, internal reconnaissance, lateral movement, and maintaining long-term remote access, before delivering the ransomware payloads.

With sanctions increasingly being used as a means to rein in ransomware attacks, in turn barring victims from negotiating with the threat actors, adding a ransomware group to a sanctions list — without naming the individuals behind it — has also been complicated by the fact that cybercriminal syndicates often tend to shutter, regroup, and rebrand under a different name to circumvent law enforcement."
